 <h2>PROJECT DONE</h2>
 <h3> 1.Sentiment Analysis using(AI & ML) IBM Naan Mudhalvan</h3>
<ul><li><p> During my project, I successfully developed a sentiment analysis model using IBM Naan
 Mudhalvan, achieving an accuracy of 84%. This project involved designing and
 implementing a machine learning-based approach for sentiment classification,
 encompassing text preprocessing, feature extraction, supervised model training, and
 polarity prediction (Positive, Negative, Neutral).The project was built using Python on the
 IBM Naan Mudhalvan and Jupyter Notebook platform, demonstrating my proficiency in
 natural language processing, machine learning, and programming. By leveraging the IBM
 Naan Mudhalvan platform, I effectively harnessed the power of AI and machine learning
 to develop an accurate sentiment analysis model.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>2.Project Tittle:Collofest - Colleges Event Management System</h3>
<ul><li><p> Developed a full-stack web-based application named ColloFest to streamline the
 management of college events such as symposiums, workshops, cultural festivals, and
 student competitions. The platform was built using React.js for the frontend to ensure a
 dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface, allowing different user rolesâ€”Admin,
 Student, and Software Adminâ€”to interact efficiently. The backend was implemented
 using Node.js, which handled server-side logic, API communication, and user
 authentication. MySQL was used for secure, structured data storage and retrieval,
 managed via phpMyAdmin. Key features included event creation and approval, student
 registration, schedule tracking, real-time notifications, and feedback
 collection. Custom CSS and Material-UI were utilized for consistent styling accessibility
 across devices. The system was tested thoroughly for performance and usability, and 
incorporated robust security practices such as role-based access control and input 
validation. ColloFest improved event coordination, reduced administrative overhead, and 
provided students with a simplified digital platform to engage with college activities. This 
project reflects strong skills in full-stack development, database integration, modular 
system architecture, and real-world user experience optimization. </p></li></ul>
